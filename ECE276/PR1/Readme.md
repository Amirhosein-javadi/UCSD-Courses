# Orientation Tracking

Our project focused on the development of a LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system tailored for a differential-drive robot. By integrating encoder and IMU odometry with 2-D LiDAR scans and RGBD measurements, along with the powerful optimization capabilities of GTSAM, we engineered a comprehensive solution to accurately localize the robot in its environment while simultaneously mapping its surroundings.

Utilizing a combination of sensor data, our system constructs a detailed 2-D occupancy grid map, providing valuable insights into the robotâ€™s surroundings and enhancing spatial understanding. Moreover, we employed RGBD images to add color information to the map, further enriching its visual representation and aiding in navigation tasks.

Through rigorous testing and validation, we ensured the reliability and accuracy of our SLAM system, making it suitable for real-world applications where precise localization and mapping are crucial. The incorporation of GTSAM optimization enhances the robustness and efficiency of our system, allowing for more accurate and reliable mapping and localization results.
